# project1 - “Submitted without Buckley’s work due to merge conflict issue.”
We are the Real Estate Consultation Group (RECG), and we have been tasked by our client to determine which region(s) in the US they should build in next, and/or the best locations in each region. The client’s primary concern are damages/losses caused by natural disasters.  This is because the client’s insurance provider considers natural disasters an “Act-of-God” and are not covered by their policy. As a result, our goal is to determine which region(s) of the US would best fit our client’s requirements based on trends observed over the last 20 years (2000 to 2020). We then framed our analysis with using 4 questions:
1. What are the natural disasters that occur?
2. What are the impacts of the natural disasters?
3. Reoccurrence of the Natural Disasters?
4. How do the natural disasters impact our development prospects?

1. What are the natural disasters that occur?
Across the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest regions the most common natural disasters over the last 20 years were, convective storms, riverine floods, and tropical cyclones.

2. What are the impacts of the natural disasters?
Across all region convective storms were affected the largest population and were the deadliest events by volume of deaths, but not the most "deadly" event. Riverine floods affected the second largest population of people and were the least deadly of our most common disasters. Tropical Cyclones impacted the smallest population of people, but are extremely deadly, causes the most damage to property and displaces more people than any other disaster.

3. Reoccurrence of the Natural Disasters?
Convective Storms occur on a yearly basis but are sporadic in volume with no distinct patterns as side from being consistent year over year. Riverine Floods are the most sporadic with no discernible patterns, but a potential correlation with tropical cyclones and convective rain event. Tropical Cyclones appear to be occurring on a cyclical basis with events occurring every 3 - 5 years.

4. How do the natural disasters impact our development prospects?
Our findings indicate that convective storms, riverine floods, and tropical cyclones have been the most common natural disasters across US for the last twenty years.  Additionally, all regions have a pattern of natural disasters that occur every ~4 years resulting in significant property damage. The most concerning of this is that these damages have been increasing over time with the most recent event resulted in record displacement.  Furthermore, the cost of damages over the last 20 years totaled over $250 billion in the Midwest, $300 billion in the Northeast, and $100 billion in the Northwest.  Due to the persistence of convective storms, riverine floods, and tropical cyclones across the country, instead of avoiding these disasters all together we located the region with the least occurrences.  Surprisingly, the region with the fewest natural disasters is the North West with a max of 4 natural disasters in per year and an average of 2 disasters yearly. The other regions averaged between 5 to 10 per year.  As a result our recommendation for our client is to build in the Northwest.

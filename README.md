We are the Real Estate Consultation Group (RECG), and we have been tasked by our client to determine which region(s) in the US they should build in next, and/or the best locations in each region.

The client’s primary concern are damages/losses caused by natural disasters.  This is because the client’s insurance provider considers natural disasters an “Act-of-God” and are not covered by their policy.

As a result, our goal is to determine which region(s) of the US would best fit our client’s requirements based on trends observed over the last 20 years (2000 to 2020).

What are the natural disasters that occur?
- In the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest regions the three most common natural disasters over the last 20 years were:
	- Convective Storms
	- Riverine Floods
	- Tropical Cyclones
What are the impacts of the natural disasters?
- Convective Storms:
- Largest population of people affected.
- Deadliest natural disaster by volume.
	- Riverine Floods:
- Second largest population of people affected.
-Least deadly of the three most common disaster.
	- Tropical Cyclones:
- Impacts the smallest population.
- Highest rate of fatality and the second most deadly disaster by volume.  
- Displaced more people than all other disaster combined.
- Caused more damage than any other natural disaster in the Northeast.
Reoccurrence of the Natural Disasters?
	- Convective Storms occur on a yearly basis but are sporadic in volume with no discernible patterns.
	- Riverine Floods are sporadic with no discernible patterns
	- Tropical Cyclones occur on a cyclical basis.


How do the natural disasters impact our development prospects?
The Eastern and Midwest region is most prone to convective storms, riverine floods, and tropical cyclones. Over the last twenty years, these regions have had a significant natural disaster resulting in significant property damage every 4 years. The most concerning of this is that these damages have been increasing each time with the most recent event resulted in record displacement. The region with the least occurring weather disasters is the North West with most 4 weather disasters in a year and an average of 2 disaster occurrences yearly. The other regions have generally over 10 in a year. The cost of damages within the past two decades totaled over $250 billion in the Midwest and over $300 billion in the Northeast. The Northwest's total damages is slightly over $100 billion.
